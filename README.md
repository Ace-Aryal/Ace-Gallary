# Ace-Gallary

This is a gallary web app made using T3 stack ( Drizzle ORM and vercel Postgre for backend)

### Database Connection

âœ… Thatâ€™s **exactly right**, and your summary is already very close.
Iâ€™ll clean it up just a bit and give you the **standard T3 + Drizzle + Neon workflow**, step by step.

---

# ðŸš€ Typical T3 stack + Drizzle + Neon setup

---

## âœ… 1. **Create your T3 app**

```bash
pnpm create t3-app
```

- Choose:

  - **TypeScript**,
  - **NextAuth (or Auth.js)**,
  - **Drizzle** (ORM),
  - **Tailwind**, etc.

This scaffolds out your app with a `/src/db.ts` or similar spot prepared for Drizzle.

---

## âœ… 2. **Deploy to Vercel & link Neon**

- Push your code to GitHub.
- Deploy on Vercel.

Inside Vercel:

- Go to **Storage â†’ Postgres** â†’ click **Create database** (itâ€™s actually Neon behind the scenes).
- It automatically:

  - Creates your Neon project,
  - Sets the `DATABASE_URL` in Vercelâ€™s Environment Variables.

âœ… You can see this in

```
Vercel dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
```

---

## âœ… 3. **Drizzleâ€™s setup out of the box**

Because T3 stackâ€™s default `create-t3-app` template is smart:

- It uses `pgTableCreator` to **prefix your tables with your app/project name**, so you can have multiple logical app DBs inside the same Neon database if needed.

Example in your `schema.ts`:

```ts
import { pgTableCreator } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const createTable = pgTableCreator((name) => `myapp_${name}`);
```

So your tables are like `myapp_user`, `myapp_post`.

---

## âœ… 4. **Local .env**

You copy your Neon `DATABASE_URL` to your local `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

Now local dev and prod both point to Neon.

---

## âœ… 5. **Your db.ts**

Usually you have this (in `src/db.ts` or `server/db.ts`):

```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/neon-http";
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
export const db = drizzle(sql);
```

âœ… Done. Now you can import `db` anywhere and write type-safe queries.

---

## âœ… 6. **Create your tables with Drizzle push**

When ready, run:

```bash
pnpm drizzle:push
```

or

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push:pg
```

ðŸ‘‰ This reads your `schema.ts` and **directly applies it to Neon**, creating tables.

(Theo style = no migrations, just direct push.)

---

## ðŸš€ âœ… So your summary is 100% right

âœ” **Create app with T3**
âœ” **Deploy to Vercel, link Neon**
âœ” **Copy `DATABASE_URL` to local .env**
âœ” **Tables are auto-prefixed for multi-project style inside one Neon DB**
âœ” **Run `db:push`**
ðŸŽ‰ Done â€” everything is connected, schema is applied.

---

âœ… Thatâ€™s the modern T3 + Drizzle + Neon flow in a nutshell.
If you ever want, I can give you a **1-page full example file tree + minimal config**, so you can just compare it to your project instantly.
